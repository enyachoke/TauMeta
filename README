The Tau Meta Tau Physica project supports open fashion design by 
enabling designers to create pattern design files that are adjusted 
to fit individual measurements, and generate SVG output for printing.

This application is developed using python and pysvg. 
Initial development was done as an Inkscape plugin.
Attribution is required if you use or port any or all of this project.

Continuing work is taking place on a 'standalone' application called 
'mkpattern', which runs on the command line and uses a pattern design 
file  (.py) and a client measurement file (.json) to generate a pattern.

This application is free software, but designers who create pattern 
designs may use any license they wish for their designs.
