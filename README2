Patterns are saved to the customer's directory by default.

If a pattern generates errors, the 'Failed to load the requested file..." error message will appear. 
Inkscape will continue to open and show a blank document. 
To see the errors, run ./tmtp.sh from a terminal. 
Error messages contain file & line number information.

To print the value of a point add print statments into your pattern file:
		print 'ad =', ad.x, ad.y, ad.name

TMTP converts client data into pixels, at 90 pixels per inch.
Convert the measurement back to centimeters or inches when printing.
	print 'waist circumference =', CD.waist_circumference*CM
	print 'waist_circumference =', CD.waist_circumference*IN

Python assumes that if a divisor is integer the result is integer.
Add a decimal point . or .0 to indicate float.
    Correct: 3/5.0 or 3/5.
    Incorrect:  3/5, as python may return 0 integer value

Pattern points have a 'name' attribute that is used as it's SVG id. 
To find a point in Inkscape you can look at the xml listing in the reference layer.
Or use <Ctrl-F> and enter the point's name.

Printing and plotting success depends on the linux/printer driver combination. 
Some linux distributions don't pass long document length to some plotter drivers, 
so pattern printout may be truncated at 54".

Printing from Inkscape:
1. Hide the reference layer and save file as PDF.
1. Select File/Document Properties.
      For Plotters:
              Enter roll width for roll paper plotters  - change dialog to use to inches or centimeters.
              Or select paper size for cut-sheet plotters.
      For Printers:
              Select paper size for your printer.
      Click on Resize Document.
      Rearrange pattern pieces if needed to fit on the paper size.  
      For plotters, the pieces can extend below bottom of page, then enter top and bottom border widths.
      Resize again & rearrange until all pieces fit on paper.
      For plotters, write down final document width & height.
2. Save as a PDF file. Files are saved to the customer's directory by default.
3. Select File/Print . The default printing dialog should appear.
      Choose the correct paper size, or input the document width and height.
      Click on Print.

Printing from GIMP:
  Open the PDF in GIMP.
  Try printing from each of the drivers listed and record which driver worked best.

Printing directly from Linux:
  Right click on the PDF. Select 'Print'. The print dialog will appear. 
  Select printer.  
  Adjust paper size to match your notes, then print.

Printing from Adobe v10+ (requires v10+ for extra long paper size, etc.)
  Right click on the PDF. Select 'Open with' and select Adobe 10.
  Adjust paper size to match your notes, then print.

If printing problems are unresolved:
 Write down the version of your operating system, 
 the make & model of your printer or plotter, 
 the paper size, 
 and the printer driver version from your operating system.
1. File a bug with your linux distribution
2. Contact the linux print working group, they're interested
3. Contact TMTP with problem & results to include in documentation

This project was a prototype. It has been superceded by
Valentina open source pattern design software (valentina-project.org).
Tau Meta still receives interest, so it is maintained.
